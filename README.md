# Counterparty Risk Analysis System


A comprehensive system for analyzing counterparty market risk in repo trading portfolios. This system processes real-world repo trade data, derives additional risk fields, and identifies high-risk counterparties based on industry-standard risk thresholds.

## Features

### üîç **Data Processing & Risk Field Derivation**
- Loads and cleans repo trade data from CSV files
- Derives 20+ additional risk fields including:
  - Credit risk scores and rating weights
  - Market risk metrics (collateral quality, haircut risk, specialness)
  - Liquidity risk measures (encumbrance, margin call risk)
  - Operational risk indicators (wrong-way risk, cross-currency risk)
  - Term risk assessments
  - Stress testing scenarios

### üìä **Counterparty Risk Analysis**
- Aggregates risk metrics at counterparty level
- Identifies high-risk counterparties using multiple criteria
- Calculates concentration risk metrics (HHI, top-5 concentration)
- Generates comprehensive risk profiles for each counterparty type

### üö® **Risk Monitoring & Alerting**
- Real-time risk flag generation
- Multi-level risk categorization (Low, Medium, High, Critical)
- Automated recommendations for risk mitigation
- Escalation thresholds for different risk levels

### üìà **Reporting & Visualization**
- Comprehensive Excel reports with multiple sheets
- Text-based summary reports
- JSON data for dashboard integration
- High-risk counterparty specific reports

## Risk Framework

### Credit Risk
- **Rating-based risk weights** (Basel III inspired)
- **High-risk rating flags** for counterparties below investment grade
- **Concentration risk** monitoring (single counterparty limits)

### Market Risk
- **Collateral quality scoring** (liquidity, volatility, duration)
- **Haircut risk assessment** based on collateral type
- **Specialness risk** for repo-specific market dynamics

### Liquidity Risk
- **Encumbrance risk** from long-term collateral commitments
- **Margin call risk** from potential funding shortfalls
- **HQLA level** monitoring for regulatory compliance

### Operational Risk
- **Wrong-way risk** identification
- **Cross-currency risk** assessment
- **CCP clearing** compliance monitoring

### Term Risk
- **Maturity risk** from long-term exposures
- **Open repo risk** from indefinite maturity trades

## Installation

1. **Clone or download the project**
```bash
cd counterparty_risk_analysis
```

2. **Install dependencies**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. **Verify data file location**
Ensure your `repo_simulation_dataset_with_cash_legs.csv` is in the `data/` directory.

## Usage

### Quick Start
```bash
cd src
python main.py
```

### Programmatic Usage
```python
from src.main import CounterpartyRiskAnalysisApp

# Initialize the application
app = CounterpartyRiskAnalysisApp("../config/risk_thresholds.yaml")

# Run analysis
results = app.run_analysis(
    data_file="../data/repo_simulation_with_cash_legs.csv",
    output_dir="../reports"
)
```

### Configuration
The system uses a YAML configuration file (`config/risk_thresholds.yaml`) that defines:
- Risk scoring weights
- Threshold values for different risk categories
- Alert and escalation levels
- Regulatory compliance limits

## Output Files

The system generates several output files in the `reports/` directory:

1. **`processed_data_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.csv`** - Enhanced dataset with all derived risk fields
2. **`counterparty_risk_analysis_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.xlsx`** - Comprehensive Excel report with multiple sheets:
   - Portfolio Summary
   - Counterparty Profiles
   - High-Risk Counterparties
3. **`risk_summary_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.txt`** - Text-based summary report
4. **`high_risk_counterparties_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.csv`** - Detailed high-risk counterparty data
5. **`dashboard_data_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.json`** - JSON data for dashboard integration

## Risk Thresholds

The system uses industry-standard risk thresholds based on:

### Regulatory Standards
- **Basel III** credit risk weights
- **LCR/NSFR** liquidity requirements
- **CCP clearing** mandates

### Industry Best Practices
- **Concentration limits** (25% single counterparty, 40% sector)
- **Haircut thresholds** (20% maximum acceptable)
- **Specialness limits** (50bp maximum)

### Risk Scoring
- **Composite risk score** (0-1 scale) combining all risk factors
- **Risk categories**: Low (‚â§0.3), Medium (‚â§0.6), High (‚â§0.8), Critical (>0.8)

## High-Risk Counterparty Identification

A counterparty is flagged as high-risk if it meets 3 or more of these criteria:
- Average risk score > 0.8
- Maximum risk score > 0.9
- Concentration ratio > 25%
- >30% of trades are high-risk
- Any critical risk trades
- Component risk scores > 0.7
